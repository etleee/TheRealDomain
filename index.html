            My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-lee-2847981b0/">Ethan Lee</a> and I am a junior computer science student at UC San Diego. Since I started learning to code, my goal has been to make technology cooler, more accessible, and something everyone can interact with. I believe that when people use technology to do amazing things, they build a relationship of sorts with that technology, and I want to help others make the most out of those relationships to bring their visions to reality.

              I am proficient with Java, Python, and the HTML/CSS/JS trio and I have experience with Agile development. With me in your organization, you donâ€™t just get a fresh engineer; You get someone who knows how to communicate ideas with diverse audiences and is willing to solve problems that others would not address.
